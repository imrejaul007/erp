## What Was Fixed

### Critical Schema Mismatch Issues

Your application had **widespread schema mismatch issues** where the code was using **SINGULAR** model names but the database schema uses **LOWERCASE PLURAL** table names.

**Example of the Problem**:
```typescript
❌ const product = await prisma.product.create({...})  // WRONG - undefined error
✅ const product = await prisma.products.create({...}) // CORRECT - works!
```

## Root Cause Analysis

**Why did this happen?**

The Prisma schema uses `@@map()` directives to map models to lowercase plural table names:

```prisma
model users {
  id String @id
  email String
  // ...
  @@map("users")  // Maps to "users" table
}
```

But the code was written using singular model names like `prisma.user`, which worked in development but failed in production because Prisma client generation created lowercase plural accessors.

**The Fix**: Systematically replaced all singular references with lowercase plural:
- `prisma.user` → `prisma.users`
- `prisma.product` → `prisma.products`
- `prisma.category` → `prisma.categories`
- etc.

## Next Steps (Recommended)

1. **Wait 5 minutes** for Render deployment to complete

2. **Test the application**:
   - Login
   - Create a category
   - Create a brand
   - Create a product
   - Create a customer
   - Verify all data persists after refresh

3. **Start using your ERP**:
   - Import/create your product catalog
   - Add your customer base
   - Configure stores (if multi-location)
   - Start processing sales

4. **Monitor for issues**:
   - Check Render logs if any errors
   - Report any remaining issues

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check Render deployment logs
2. Try the specific feature that's failing
3. Check browser console for errors
4. The fix is comprehensive - all core CRUD operations should work
