# ‚úÖ Data Saving Verification Checklist

## üéØ QUICK CHECK: Is Your Data Saving?

Answer these questions to verify:

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 1: Did You Update Render Environment Variables?

**Question**: Did you go to Render Dashboard ‚Üí Environment and manually add these variables?

- [ ] NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.onrender.com
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.onrender.com
- [ ] NODE_ENV=production
- [ ] NEXTAUTH_SECRET=qHpm7fQyVhb1DisPoJ22di7iHLKpeZmSqLn8uvxa3ZI=

## üéØ INTERPRETING RESULTS

### ‚úÖ ALL TESTS PASSED
**Congratulations!** Your data is saving correctly!

**What this means**:
- Environment variables are correct
- Authentication is working
- Database is connected
- System is production-ready

**Next Steps**:
- Start using the system
- Add real products and customers
- Train your team

---

### ‚ùå TESTS FAILED - Troubleshooting

#### Scenario 1: "Cannot Login"
**Symptoms**: Login page shows error or redirects to localhost

**Cause**: Environment variables not updated or wrong URL

**Fix**:
1. Go to Render Dashboard ‚Üí Environment
2. Check NEXTAUTH_URL exactly matches your Render URL
3. Must be `https://` not `http://`
4. Must match EXACTLY (no trailing slash)
5. Save and redeploy

---

#### Scenario 2: "Login Works But Data Doesn't Save"
**Symptoms**: Can login, but clicking Save does nothing or shows error

**Possible Causes**:

**A. Not Actually Logged In**
- Check top-right corner for your name
- If no name shown ‚Üí Not logged in
- Login again

**B. Browser Console Errors**
- Press F12 ‚Üí Console tab
- Look for red errors
- Common errors:
  - "401 Unauthorized" ‚Üí Not logged in
  - "Network Error" ‚Üí Wrong API URL
  - "Tenant not found" ‚Üí Database not seeded

**C. Database Not Seeded**
- Run in Render Shell:
  ```bash
  npm run db:seed
  npm run db:seed:platform
  ```

---

#### Scenario 3: "Data Saves But Disappears After Refresh"
**Symptoms**: Data appears initially but gone after refresh

**Cause**: Data saved to wrong database or local storage only

**Fix**:
1. Check DATABASE_URL in Render environment
2. Should be your PostgreSQL URL (starts with postgresql://)
3. Verify data in database:
   - Go to Render ‚Üí PostgreSQL service
   - Connect and run: `SELECT * FROM products;`
   - Should see your data

---

#### Scenario 4: "Everything Worked Yesterday, Broken Today"
**Symptoms**: Was working, now suddenly not saving

**Possible Causes**:

**A. Session Expired**
- Solution: Login again

**B. Environment Variable Changed**
- Check Render ‚Üí Environment
- Someone may have changed variables
- Restore correct values

**C. Database Connection Issue**
- Check Render logs for database errors
- Verify DATABASE_URL is correct

---

## üîç DETAILED DIAGNOSTICS

### Check 1: Verify Environment Variables

**In Render Dashboard ‚Üí Environment, verify**:

```
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://[your-app].onrender.com (no localhost!)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://[your-app].onrender.com (matches above!)
NODE_ENV=production (not development!)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... (your PostgreSQL URL)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=(some long random string)
```

**Common Mistakes**:
- ‚ùå `http://localhost:3000`
- ‚ùå `development` instead of `production`
- ‚ùå Missing `https://`
- ‚ùå Trailing slash at end

---

### Check 2: Verify Deployment

**In Render Dashboard ‚Üí Events**:

Latest deployment should show:
```
‚úÖ Build succeeded
‚úÖ Deploy live
```

If you see errors, read the logs.

---

### Check 3: Check Render Logs

**In Render Dashboard ‚Üí Logs**:

Look for errors like:
- "NEXTAUTH_URL is not defined"
- "Database connection failed"
- "Tenant not found"
- "Unauthorized"

These tell you what's wrong.

---

### Check 4: Browser Console

**Press F12 ‚Üí Console tab while using app**:

Try to save data, look for:
- üî¥ Red errors = Something wrong
- üü¢ Green/no errors = Likely working

Common errors:
- "401 Unauthorized" ‚Üí Not logged in
- "403 Forbidden" ‚Üí No permissions
- "Network Error" ‚Üí Wrong URLs in environment

---

### Check 5: Network Tab

**Press F12 ‚Üí Network tab**:

When you click Save, watch for:
- POST request to `/api/products` or `/api/customers`
- Status 200 or 201 = Success ‚úÖ
- Status 401 = Not logged in ‚ùå
- Status 500 = Server error ‚ùå

---

## üìä VERIFICATION DATABASE QUERY

To check if data is ACTUALLY in the database:

### In Render PostgreSQL Dashboard:

**Connect and run**:

```sql
-- Check for products
SELECT id, name, sku, "unitPrice", "createdAt"
FROM products
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check for customers
SELECT id, name, email, phone, "createdAt"
FROM customers
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check for sales
SELECT id, "saleNumber", "totalAmount", "createdAt"
FROM sales
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**If you see data here** = Saving works! ‚úÖ
**If tables are empty** = Data not saving ‚ùå

---
