## 🔧 KEY LEARNINGS

### Schema Requirements Discovered:

**Common Patterns**:
1. Many models require `updatedAt: new Date()` on create/update
2. Number fields (saleNo, paymentNo, etc.) are often String type
3. Unique fields must be provided (cannot be auto-generated)
4. Some tables use different field names than expected:
   - `method` not `paymentMethod`
   - `saleNo` not `saleNumber`
   - `totalAmount` not `total`
   - `createdById` not `userId`

**Field Naming Patterns**:
- User references: `createdById`, `updatedById`, `approvedById`
- Number fields: `saleNo`, `paymentNo`, `customerNo` (String, unique)
- Amount fields: `totalAmount`, `subtotal`, `vatAmount` (Decimal)
- Status fields: Usually enum types (SaleStatus, PaymentStatus, etc.)
