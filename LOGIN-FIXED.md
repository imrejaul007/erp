# Login & Authentication - COMPLETELY FIXED ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: 100% WORKING
**All Issues Resolved**: YES ✅

---

## ✅ PROBLEMS FOUND & FIXED

### **Problem 1: Auth System Was Broken** ❌
The authentication system was hardcoding all users' roles to 'USER' instead of reading from the database.

**Code Before (Broken)**:
```typescript
// lib/auth-simple.ts line 67
role: 'USER', // Default role since table doesn't have role column
```

**Code After (Fixed)**:
```typescript
// Get user's role from database
const userRole = user.user_roles && user.user_roles.length > 0
  ? user.user_roles[0].roles.name
  : 'USER';

role: userRole, // ✅ Now reads from database!
```

---

### **Problem 2: User Had No Role Assigned** ❌
The admin user existed in the database but had no role assigned, causing API permission checks to fail.

**Fixed By**:
- Created OWNER role in database
- Assigned OWNER role to admin@oudperfume.ae
- User now has full permissions

---

### **Problem 3: Product Creation Failed** ❌
Because the user had role='USER' (hardcoded) and no actual role in database, the product API rejected requests:

```typescript
// API checks:
if (!['OWNER', 'ADMIN', 'MANAGER', 'INVENTORY'].includes(user.role)) {
  return apiError('Insufficient permissions', 403);
}
```

With role='USER', this check failed!

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS FIXED

1. **Updated Authentication Logic** (`lib/auth-simple.ts`)
   - Now retrieves user roles from `user_roles` relationship
   - Fixed in both `authorize()` and `jwt()` callbacks
   - Properly queries database for role information

2. **Assigned OWNER Role to Admin User**
   - Created OWNER role in roles table
   - Created user_roles entry linking admin to OWNER role
   - Admin now has full system permissions

3. **Created Diagnostic Tools**
   - `check-login.mjs` - Checks authentication system
   - `fix-user-role.mjs` - Assigns OWNER role to users
