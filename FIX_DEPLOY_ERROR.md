# üîß Fix Render Deploy Error - Status 1

## Current Issue

Build is failing with **"Exited with status 1"**. This is a generic error that means the build process crashed.

## üéØ Immediate Solutions (Try in Order)

### Solution 1: Check Deploy Logs (MOST IMPORTANT)

**You need to see the actual error message:**

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click on your `oud-erp` web service
3. Click **"Logs"** tab (or "Events")
4. Scroll to the failed deploy
5. Look for the **last error message** before "Exited with status 1"

**Common errors you might see:**
- `Error: Cannot find module...` ‚Üí Missing dependency
- `Error: Database connection failed` ‚Üí Wrong DATABASE_URL
- `Error: Out of memory` ‚Üí Need paid plan
- `Error: Command "..." not found` ‚Üí Missing script
- `TypeError:` or `ReferenceError:` ‚Üí Code error

**‚Üí Share the error message and I can give you the exact fix!**

### Solution 2: Try Minimal Build (Skip Database Setup)

The database push might be causing issues. Let's try building without it first:

1. Go to your web service ‚Üí **Settings**
2. Find **"Build Command"**
3. Change it to: `npm install && npm run build:render:minimal`
4. Save and **trigger manual deploy**

This will:
- ‚úÖ Install dependencies
- ‚úÖ Generate Prisma client
- ‚úÖ Build Next.js
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Skip database push (we'll do it manually after)

---

### Solution 3: Use Completely Manual Database Setup

If the build keeps failing with Prisma, we can separate database setup from build:

**Build Command:**
```bash
npm install && npx prisma generate && npm run build
```

**Then after deployment, in Shell:**
```bash
npx prisma db push
npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
```

---

### Solution 4: Check Environment Variables

Missing or wrong env vars can cause status 1 error:

**Required Variables:**
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@xxx.internal:5432/db
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.onrender.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<generated>
```

**Check:**
- [ ] DATABASE_URL uses **Internal** URL (not External)
- [ ] DATABASE_URL is from your actual `oud-erp-db` database
- [ ] NEXTAUTH_URL matches your actual service URL
- [ ] No typos in variable names

---

### Solution 5: Upgrade to Paid Plan ($7/month)

Free tier has limitations that can cause status 1:
- 512MB RAM (might not be enough)
- Limited build time (10 minutes)
- Shared CPU

**Paid Starter plan ($7/month) gives:**
- 2GB RAM
- Dedicated CPU
- 20 minute build time

This often fixes mysterious build failures.

## üîç Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Identify Exact Error

Look at the logs and find the **last few lines** before failure. Common patterns:

#### Error Pattern 1: Dependency Issues
```
npm ERR! code ENOENT
npm ERR! Could not read package.json
```
**Fix:** Ensure package.json is committed to Git

#### Error Pattern 2: Database Connection
```
Error: Can't reach database server
```
**Fix:** Check DATABASE_URL is Internal URL

#### Error Pattern 3: Memory Issues
```
JavaScript heap out of memory
```
**Fix:** Upgrade to paid plan

#### Error Pattern 4: TypeScript Errors
```
Type error: ...
```
**Fix:** Run `npm run type-check` locally and fix errors

#### Error Pattern 5: Missing Files
```
Module not found: Can't resolve './components/...'
```
**Fix:** Ensure all files are committed to Git

## üìã Checklist Before Next Deploy

- [ ] All code is committed and pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Database `oud-erp-db` is running and shows "Available"
- [ ] DATABASE_URL is set to **Internal** database URL
- [ ] NEXTAUTH_URL matches your service name
- [ ] Build command is: `npm install && npm run build:render:minimal`
- [ ] Node version in package.json: `"node": ">=18.17.0"`

## üéØ Recommended Approach

Since blueprints keep failing, **I recommend manual deployment**:

### Step 1: Delete Current Web Service
- Keep the database!
- Delete only the failing web service

### Step 2: Create New Web Service Manually

1. **New + ‚Üí Web Service**
2. **Repository:** `imrejaul007/erp`
3. **Settings:**
   ```
   Build Command: npm install && npm run build:render:minimal
   Start Command: npm run start
   ```

4. **Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production
   DATABASE_URL=<your Internal DB URL>
   NEXTAUTH_URL=https://oud-erp.onrender.com
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<generate>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://oud-erp.onrender.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=Oud & Perfume ERP
   ```

### Step 3: After Deployment, Setup Database

Once the service is running, go to Shell tab and run:

```bash
# Push database schema
npx prisma db push

# Seed initial data
npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
```

This separates concerns and makes debugging easier.

## üÜò If Still Failing

### Share These Details:

1. **Full error message** from logs (last 20 lines)
2. **Build command** you're using
3. **Environment variables** you have set (hide passwords)
4. **Screenshot** of the error (if helpful)

### I'll Help You:
- Identify the exact issue
- Provide the specific fix
- Guide you through deployment

---

## ‚ö° Quick Test Locally

Before deploying again, test the build locally:

```bash
cd "/Users/rejaulkarim/Documents/Oud PMS"

# Test the build command
npm install
npm run build:render:minimal

# If it fails locally, we know it's a code issue
# If it works locally but fails on Render, it's an environment issue
```

---

## üìû Next Steps

1. **Check the logs** and find the actual error
2. **Share the error message** so I can help
3. **Try Solution 2** (minimal build) if you can't find the error
4. **Consider manual deployment** (recommended for troubleshooting)

**The logs will tell us exactly what's wrong! üîç**
