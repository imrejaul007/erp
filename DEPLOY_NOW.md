# 🚀 DEPLOY NOW - Final Steps

## ✅ Code Successfully Pushed to GitHub!

Your repository: **https://github.com/imrejaul007/erp**

---

## 🎯 Next: Deploy to Render (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Render Dashboard

Open in your browser:
```
https://dashboard.render.com
```

Sign up or log in.

---

### Step 2: Create New Blueprint

1. Click **"New +"** button (top right)
2. Select **"Blueprint"**
3. Click **"Deploy from a Git repository"**
4. **Connect GitHub** (if not connected already)
   - Authorize Render to access your repositories
5. **Select Repository:** `imrejaul007/erp`
6. Click **"Connect"**

---

### Step 3: Render Auto-Deploys Everything

Render will detect `render.yaml` and automatically:

✅ Create PostgreSQL database: `oud-erp-db`
✅ Create web service: `oud-erp`
✅ Link them together
✅ Start deployment

**Just click "Apply" when prompted!**

---

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables

After the blueprint creates services, go to:

**Dashboard → Your Web Service → Environment**

Add these two required variables:

```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://oud-erp.onrender.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<Click "Generate" button to auto-generate>
```

**Important:** Replace `oud-erp` with your actual service name from Render!

Then click **"Save Changes"**

---

### Step 5: Wait for Build (5-10 minutes)

Watch the build logs. You'll see:

```
✓ Cloning repository
✓ Installing dependencies (npm install)
✓ Generating Prisma Client
✓ Creating database schema
  → Creating 45+ tables including:
    - sampling_sessions
    - sampling_products
    - tester_stock
    - tester_refills
    - users, products, stores, etc.
✓ Seeding database
  → Admin user created
  → Sample data added
✓ Building Next.js application
✓ Starting server
✓ Deployment live!
```

---
