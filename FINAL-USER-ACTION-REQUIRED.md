### ⚠️  WHAT YOU MUST DO MANUALLY:

**Only 1 thing remains** - and I **CANNOT** do it automatically:

## 🔴 **CHANGE THE ADMIN PASSWORD**

**Why I can't do this**:
- ❌ Requires your current password (which I don't have)
- ❌ Must be done through authenticated web interface
- ❌ Security-sensitive operation requiring user action
- ❌ Cannot be scripted for security reasons

**Why YOU must do it**:
- 🔐 Only you know the current password
- 🔐 Only you can set the new password
- 🔐 Security requires human verification
- 🔐 Protects your business data
